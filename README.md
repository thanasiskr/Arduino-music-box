# Arduino-music-box
An arduino sketch for a music box. Music starts playing when the lid of the box is open and stops when the lid is closed.
This project uses an IR proximity sensor to detect the opening or the closing of the box. Music is played via the DFplayer mini MP3 module, which uses a micro SD card to store the music files. The default playback mode of the project is to play each song in sequence.
